<!--l. 2234--><p class="noindent" >The choice to use Github, and to separate the Experiment Factory into its underlying components
(experiments, battery, docker, documentation, and vm) was a specific choice to allow specialization
and collaboration in development. Github offers version control, management of code, and
collaboration between teams, along with features such as reporting issues, discussing changes, and
managing documentation. All versions of code are archived, and multiple features can be worked on
simultaneously by any researcher with an internet connection. Github also provides Continuous
Integration, or automatic testing of code, both for the experiments and expfactory-python, discussed
next.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">A.4.2   </span> <a 
 id="x33-97000A.4.2"></a>Software testing for the Experiment Factory</h4>
<!--l. 2247--><p class="noindent" >An essential component of software development is continuous testing of all functions whenever
changes are made to the software in the case that a change breaks an essential functionality.
This task, called Continuous Integration, can be done automatically when new changes are
proposed to code on Github with services like CircleCI ((<a 
href="https://circleci.com/" >https://circleci.com/</a>) and Travis
(<a 
href="https://travis-ci.com/" >https://travis-ci.com/</a>). The base software to run the Experiment Factory (expfactory-python)
is consistently tested in this fashion, however a significant challenge in the development of
this infrastructure was ensuring functionality of the experiments themselves. An error in an
experiment at run-time would end a battery, and must be avoided at all costs. Toward this goal,
the Experiment Factory has several strategies for testing experiment code in a Continuous
Integration environment. First, testing of experiments includes using jshint, a JavaScript quality
tool, to parse experiment code files for static errors. The validation of experiments config.json
data structures also occurs in the Continuous Integration environment, as does testing the
experiments at run-time. This is made possible by using an automated web browser, selenium
(<a 
href="http://www.seleniumhq.org" >http://www.seleniumhq.org</a>), controlled by python functions from expfactory-python that respond to the
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
stimuli, akin to running an experiment robot. When experiments are modified, the experiment robot
is run over these changed experiments to ensure no run-time errors, triggering an error to
fail the Continuous Integration tests if any errors are found. During this process, developers
can discuss changes and issues using the standard forums for reporting issues and discussing
development that are provided by Github. This collaborative coding environment has been an
essential component for our group to develop, pilot, and discuss the application. Using version
control was an essential factor for the Experiment Factory to follow the vision of reproducible
science.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">A.4.3   </span> <a 
 id="x33-98000A.4.3"></a>The Cognitive Atlas</h4>
<!--l. 2277--><p class="noindent" >The Cognitive Atlas [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] is an ontology that represents current knowledge about cognitive science.
Integration of standard terms to describe the tasks, and consequently, the cognitive concepts that are
measured by them, allows for researchers to map all experiments into a common space, and use a common
language to describe the behavior and phenomena that are being measured. This means that, for example,
a researcher can quickly find experiments that are asserted to measure &#8220;risk seeking,&#8221; and such a feature is
not only important for definition of these experiments, but also for meta-analysis and reproducible
science. The expfactory.github.io experiment portal, along with documentation and testing of
experiments, offers a view to browse experiments based on the cognitive concepts that are measured,
as defined in the Cognitive Atlas. Mapping experiments to the Cognitive Atlas and making
assertions about the cognitive concepts measured by the experiments is powerful in that it allows
researchers to select paradigms based on the specific cognitive functions that they are thought to
measure.
