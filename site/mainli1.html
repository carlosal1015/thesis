<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >We can imagine a single statistical result as an effort to capture a scene. Early master painters, if we might
say their efforts were to reproduce such a scene, were put out of work with the advent of the photograph. A
photographer who develops film was replaced by the printer, and then digital photography
exploded&#x00A0;each single print to hundreds or thousands of digits. We are now in an era defined by
scientific breakthrough, and the master painters are the scientists trying to capture the human
condition.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   For decades, it was acceptable to capture such scenes, and write about findings with words and pictures.
This practice will never scale to keep up with production rate of these artists, and further, we now have a
small mountain of paintings that must somehow be synthesized into a coherent, holistic picture. This is not
to say that we should change our expectations for the quality of the work, or to instill rigid
layout specifications to limit the creativity of the artist. We must figure out how to produce,
understand, and archive such results with the quality and flexibility that we desire en-masse.
And just like the photograph, the answer is not in the content of the paintings, but in the
technology to derive and understand them. In the academic halls of fame, infrastructure and method
have taken a back seat to biological discovery, until it now is clear that biological discovery
will not move forward without the proper infrastructure and methods in place. I cannot say
that it is not valuable to ask good biological questions, but I am driven to build tools. If we
want reproducible science, and continued discovery, the academic software developer must
assert himself and his work. Toward this goal I have solidified my passion, and am driven to
provide example and leadership in informatics. I will devote the rest of my life toward this
goal.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   This dissertation is a subset of work I completed to complete my graduate training in the Biomedical
Informatics program at Stanford Medical School. My contributions span both biomedical and informatics,
meaning that I have derived not only methodology that dually supports our understanding of the human
brain, but infrastructure to support it.
