<!--l. 2373--><p class="noindent" >A dataset or result is only as meaningful as the producer&#8217;s ability to effectively communicate its content,
making proper data visualization essential for the communication and synthesis of ideas. For highly
complex, multi-dimensional data produced in the field of brain imaging, this task presents substantial
challenges. One pertinent example occurs in a developing field of brain imaging, functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), which aims to understand the dynamic interactions between regions of the brain
that work together to produce cognition, thought and behavior &#8211; the so-called &#8220;functional connectome&#8221;
([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? ? ? ? </span>]). The statistical analysis of this data is highly complex, and typically involves
preprocessing to remove unwanted artifactual noise, the performance of a statistical test, correction for
multiple comparisons to assess significance, and finally, the dissemination of results to the broader
neuroimaging community ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? </span>]). While much innovation has occurred in desktop applications to
visualize these data, significant results are typically reported in a textual format, with perhaps
one or two static images of a selected region of the brain. This dated strategy presents with
significant problems. For instance, the selection of a particular set of brain slices, different statistical
thresholds, choices of field of view, and coloring biases the image to communicate a strategic
point, potentially clouding the interpretation of results. Neuroimaging researchers cannot spend
substantial time developing novel visualization strategies, and so static images produced by standard
software ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? </span>]) become the basis for the visualization of the result. This standard is simply
unacceptable during a time when web visualization technology [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] is blossoming, calling for
tools to not only properly visualize a functional connectome, but to make it available in a
web browser, interactive and intuitive, allowing for exploration of the data to generate novel
hypotheses.
<!--l. 2375--><p class="indent" >   This chapter presents a prototype of such a tool for exploration of brain functional connectivity data,
and a review of challenges faced for the visualization of this data. I will first review background of fMRI
connectivity analyses, with the goal of making transparent the data that defines the creation of these
functional connectomes. I will then introduce visualization as a powerful tool to explore distributions and
patterns in these data, and review current tools and strategies for functional connectivity visualization. I
will then briefly discuss current publication practices, and introduce a novel prototype interface that
could integrate into such practices that better empowers the researcher to visualize a functional
connectome. Finally, I will discuss current limitations of the prototype, and long term vision for this
work.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">B.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x37-107000B.1.1"></a>Derivation of the functional connectome</h4>
<!--l. 2378--><p class="noindent" >Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an established imaging protocol for assessing activity in
the human brain. fMRI measures the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response, an indirect measure
of local neuronal signaling, that can subsequently be used to investigate functional differences between
individuals and behavioral states ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>]). A typical experiment involves the collection of BOLD data from a
series of &#8220;voxels&#8221; (akin to three dimensional pixels) that cover the entire brain over the course of an
experiment (either task-based or &#8220;resting&#8221; quietly). This data is then analyzed in the context of a
hypothesis, and the basis of the hypothesis informs the resulting processing and statistical analysis. For
example, an investigator interested in temporal relations between different parts of the brain, called the
&#8220;functional connectome&#8221; will begin with a four dimensional dataset having three spatial dimensions, and
one temporal dimension. Each 3D voxel contains a value that reflects the BOLD response,
and so a plot of this value over time reflects a proxy of a neuronal activity at that spatial
location. Assessing the similarity of these timecourses for all voxels in the brain is the basis of
functional connectivity analyses, as voxels with correlated temporal activity are hypothesized to
be synchronously active. Thus, the result of a functional connectivity analysis is typically a
square connectivity matrix, where each coordinate (a voxel ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]), region ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>]), or data-driven
parcellation ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? </span>])) represents some probability of connection (correlation) between two
coordinates. This presents with the first challenge of data visualization &#8211; the responsibility of
properly representing uncertainty in the data. The second challenge is thresholding to reduce the
dimensionality of the data. A typical imaging sequence with images of size 91 x 109 x 91 can result in
approximately 25,000,000K values in the matrix, however since spatially similar regions are
highly correlated ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]), it is ideal to reduce the size by defining meaningful parcels of related
voxels.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">B.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x37-108000B.1.2"></a>Methods for visualization of a functional connectome</h4>
<!--l. 2381--><p class="noindent" >The core goal of a functional connectome visualization is thus to reveal which parts of the brain are most
likely to be working synchronously. An ideal visualization will show where significant connections occur,
and how confident one can be about their presence. The visualization must use color, depth, dimensions,
thickness, and controls responsibly so this simple goal is not lost. Historically, the derivation of a static
brain image has been to inform about a specific result, however with the explosion of novel imaging
technology ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>]), and databases ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? ? ? </span>]), this task has shifted from a reporting to an investigatory
one. I will first discuss the progression, advantages, and disadvantages of tools for visualizing connectivity
graphs, and transition into the methods for the development of a prototype to address current
challenges.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
<!--l. 2383--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x37-109000B.1.2"></a>Traditional orthogonal views</h5>
<!--l. 2384--><p class="noindent" >The earliest derivations of functional connectivity reflect the limitations of early software, meaning
visualization of any brain-based data was limited to the orthogonal views of a three-dimensional
brain (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x37-1120011">B.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:62 --></a>a). Traditional software packages ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>]) offer some version of a viewer to
overlay a functional result on an anatomical image, and the choice of slice to show reflects the
bias of the creator. A common analysis suite, Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>])
developed the &#8220;glass brain,&#8221; a maximum intensity projection, as a means to literally make results
transparent.
<!--l. 2386--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x37-110000B.1.2"></a>A jump to graph-based approaches</h5>
<!--l. 2387--><p class="noindent" >The traditional glass brain presents with the problem that these connectivity graphs are not focused on the
spatial locations themselves, but rather, the relationships between them. This is an example of a
visualization strategy not well fit to the data being visualized. A natural progression was to represent
connectivity matrices with traditional graph-based approaches, meaning networks of nodes and links
between them (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x37-1120011">B.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:62 --></a>b) ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]). Strength between connections, or uncertainty, could be illustrated with
subtle differences in color or line thickness, and regional information could be added based on positioning
or coloring. However, the weakness in these visualizations is that intuitive spatial representation is lost ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">?</span>
<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]).
<!--l. 2389--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x37-111000B.1.2"></a>Connectivity visualized on three-dimensional brains</h5>
<!--l. 2390--><p class="noindent" >The next logical step was to overlay these connectivity maps back onto anatomical brains (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x37-1120011">B.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:62 --></a>c) ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">?</span>
<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]). While this restores the spatial meaning, there are several issues with this approach. While
three-dimensional renders are more visually appealing, the added dimension risks over-complicating the
visualization ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]), or taxing the web browser ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]). Further, a static visualization of a three-dimensional
image can hide data.
<!--l. 2392--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x37-112000B.1.2"></a>Bundled connections</h5>
<!--l. 2393--><p class="noindent" >These early visualizations shed light on another important observation &#8211; it is more important to synthesize
what the links represent than visualize the links themselves. Therefore, the field returned to more
traditional &#8220;graph based&#8221; approaches. With previous methods, distance represented spatial distance in
anatomical space. With new methods, distance represents connection strength ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]). The &#8220;force directed
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
graph&#8221; (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x37-1120011">B.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:62 --></a>d) available in a software package like Gephi ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]) was a powerful strategy
to very quickly show functional relationships between regions. The idea of &#8220;bundling&#8221; grew
out of this work, or grouping connections that might be grouped based on an unsupervised
hierarchical clustering of the data (Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x37-1120011">B.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:62 --></a>e) ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>]). It followed to neatly organize this data
in a circle, a graph called a &#8220;connectogram&#8221; ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]), and arrange the nodes around the circle
to reflect positioning in the brain from front to back. This is the current state of functional
connectivity visualization, which must be better integrated into web browsers and journals for
publication.

<!--l. 2405--><p class="noindent" >The sheer complexity of these datasets contrasts with the limitations of the amount of data that can be
shown in a web browser, which is largely dependent on the memory of the machine accessing it. Methods
such as caching, edge computing, data replication, and proper utilization of database querying make the
goal of showing some aspect of functional connectivity data a reasonable one. In print media, the standard
of publication is tied back to our preference to read books, and scientific journals themselves, which dates
back to 1665 when Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society was released as the first
exclusively scientific journal. The modern version of this trend is distribution of electronic
articles, many of which are packaged nicely into PDF files. Researchers typically export an
image from a software tool, and then add additional labels or coloring in a vector graphics
program. This procedure is highly time intensive, and unfortunately, it is not a requirement to
share the production procedure. It would be highly valuable to have a web framework that
not only standardizes the data processing, but also provides standards for visualization of the
result.
