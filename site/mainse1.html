<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >Brain health is a general idea to describe of how memory, decision making, and other cognitive processes
change over time. Brain health is important to study because of its implications for mental health, which
broadly describes an individual&#8217;s well-being. Unfortunately, all is not well. Mental health has
reached a crisis state in the United States, with the cost of &#8220;severely debilitating&#8221; disorders
alone accruing to a total of $300 billion annually [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. These disorders are complex syndromes,
with evidence for problems with brain connectivity [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>] resulting&#x00A0;from poorly understood
interactions between environmental, and genetic variables [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] Essential to developing informed
intervention for these aberrant cognitive processes and behaviors is continual growth of our
understanding how environment [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] behavior [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], and developmental variables [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>] are related to
brain function, and impetus to redefine these disorders in a space of data-driven, biological
metrics. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] established by the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is such a space, including several domains (cognition, social
processes, arousal/regulatory systems, negative and positive valence systems), each of which can be
described with genetic, neural, and behavioral features. While each domain has potential value to
redefine definitions of disorders, compelling research has shown a strong link between cognition
and mental health [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], and so a data-driven strategy to computationally describe and define
cognitive processes would be a significant contribution toward helping solve the mental health
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
crisis.

 id="x11-90001.1.1"></a>The link between cognition and brain health</h4>
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" >Cognition broadly encompasses the domains of memory, attention, decision making, regulatory behaviors,
abstract thinking, and language. For some individuals (an estimated <img 
src="main0x.png" alt="&#x02DC;1  "  class="tilde" >8% of adults in the United States [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">?</span>
]) problems arising in any of these domains can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. We
call these patterns of aberrant processes mental illness, and historically our definition of these
patterns has been categorical, defined in a book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Illness (DSM) [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. In spirit of the RDoC initiative, badly needed is a data-driven
understanding of how cognitive processes map to behavior, however such an understanding is a
chicken and egg problem. Due to observing cognitive deficits in many disorders, it might be a
natural strategy to assume that such deficits appear as a result of a disorder. Recent work [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]
has suggested a new perspective that encourages viewing cognitive function less as a passive
symptom, and more as a target for treatment. Aberrant cognitive processes can not only be
measured to indicate present disorder, but also can be used to predict the course of an illness,
or progress in treatment. Thus, we need cognitive neuroscience to better characterize mental
illness.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x11-100001.1.2"></a>Non-invasive brain imaging as a means to measure cognition</h4>
<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >A majority of knowledge about cognition, specifically the linking between desirable or undesirable
behaviors and cognitive processes, comes by way of non-invasive brain imaging. Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allows for the measurement of biological and cognitive variables during the
live experience of some task paradigm. fMRI has given huge insight to our understanding of
brain networks associated with domains of behavior (see [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] for a review), however it remains
the case that neuroimaging technology supplemented by expertise in cognitive neuroscience,
has not yet robustly characterized mental illness. Aside from issues related to power [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] or
reproducible practices [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? </span>] why might this be the case? Variability in image acquisition
protocols [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], especially for smaller brain regions [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], is an influential factor when assessing the
reproducibility of a result. However, metrics such as signal to noise ratio (SNR) are routinely
used to provide best practices for advances in technology [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], and educate researches on the
protocols [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. A larger challenge is instilling best practices for the parameters used during image
processing ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? </span>]), and efforts like the Stanford Reproducibility Center for Neuroscience
(<a 
href="http://reproducibility.stanford.edu" >http://reproducibility.stanford.edu</a>) will be able to instill standardization by offering analysis as a service,
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
and by taking a data-driven approach to defining reproducibility. The center can optimize
analysis pipelines by running an equivalent dataset through all possible pipelines, and choosing a
processing strategy that, for example, maximizes signal to noise, number of activated voxels [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">?</span>
], or optimizes another metric of interest. The issue of variability at the level of acquisition
has also been helped by large efforts such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>]
that have combined expertise of many neuroimaging scientists to establish robust pipelines
that the larger community can exemplify. Finally, it isn&#8217;t clear that consensus across scanning
parameters is ideal. In the field of radiology, for example, there is huge diversity in terms of
hardware and protocol, yet radiologists at different institutions are still able to successfully
make diagnoses from images independently of the machine used. Arguably, a brain phenomena
that is robust (and not noise itself) will emerge despite subtle differences in the acquisition
technology.
<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >   Arguably, the missing link is a validated connection between patterns of brain activation present in
fMRI, and specific cognitive processes. If we could make assertions that particular patterns of brain
activation that are understood as functional networks are indicative of particular cognitive processes, it
would be possible to measure such networks in individuals with mental illness for purpose of diagnosis or
treatment. The first step is a proper definition of the space of cognitive processes, and relationships
between them.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x11-110001.1.3"></a>The Cognitive Atlas</h4>
<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >Understanding of the underlying drivers and influences on behavioral outcomes usually starts with a
specific behavior or cognitive phenomena of interest. Let&#8217;s say that we enter a cafe, and enter an interesting
conversation with a behavioral researcher. As he describes how some people have aberrant behavior
related to decision making, the researcher might use terms such as &#8220;impulsivity,&#8221; &#8220;choice,&#8221; or
&#8220;risk,&#8221; when describing his hypotheses about how integration of different cognitive processes can
lead to something that looks like &#8220;decision making.&#8221; In fact, he has designed an experiment
to measure his phenomena of interest. Given the success of his experiment, how might we
categorize the resulting data if we, at some point in the future, wanted to do a large-scale
meta-analysis about decision making? It should be immediately clear that if we do not have a
standard terminology for describing different cognitive paradigms, their conditions, and the
cognitive processes measured, we will not be able to make any inferences with semantic features
like &#8220;choice&#8221; and &#8220;risk&#8221; that are directly relevant to the cognitive processes that we wish to
study.
<!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   The Cognitive Atlas [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] is an effort to represent, formally, concepts in cognitive science. It can
represent, in a standardized way, different experimental paradigms and cognitive processes. An analogy can
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
be made to the better known Gene Ontology (GO), an ontology that has driven discovery
in biology by mapping all gene products into three domains, including cellular components,
molecular components, or biological processes [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. In the same way that we can derive that
&#8220;regulation of collagen binding&#8221; and &#8220;regulation of receptor binding&#8221; are similar in that they
share a common parent of &#8220;regulation of protein binding,&#8221; by knowing that &#8220;inhibition&#8221; and
&#8220;updating&#8221; are kinds of &#8220;cognitive control,&#8221; we can use these relationships to drive discovery in
cognitive science. By mapping these terms &#8220;inhibition&#8221; and &#8220;updating&#8221; into the Cognitive
Atlas, we can discover the parent term of &#8220;cognitive control&#8221; and integrate this relationship
into an analysis that might have otherwise treated brain maps with these &#8220;different&#8221; labels as
entirely different things. The open source and public nature of the ontology means that future
researchers can use and critique terms, and better refine our understanding of concepts in cognitive
science.
<!--l. 204--><p class="indent" >   This approach does not come without challenges. Development of the ontology itself is an arduous
process that requires substantial expertise, and is prone to disagreement. Ideally, defining relationships
between terms would be done programmatically with careful steps such as validation done via manual
intervention. Arguably, cognitive neuroscience has not made substantial advancement to lead to
development of a modern vocabulary (Poldrack, Duke University April 2016), and it isn&#8217;t clear if the terms
typically used in manuscripts (e.g., working memory, decision making, risk seeking) represent the field&#8217;s
best effort. Quality of definitions may not be consistent across terms, and so work would be needed to
assess the validity of the terms. Finally, definition of terms is not enough to build the ontology, as
relationships between terms must be identified as well. Despite these limitations, a standard description
such as the Cognitive Atlas is an essential component to a framework that aims to measure cognitive
processes.
