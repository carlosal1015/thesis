<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >Mental illness is the unspoken disease that fills the lives of its sufferers with penetrating darkness. In the
year 2014 it was estimated that 18.1 % of U.S. adults experienced a mental illness in the past year [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], an
alarming prevalence that has allowed mental illness to account for the highest percentage of disability
adjusted life years globally [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. Our current definition of mental illness stems from the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual (DSM), currently in its fifth edition [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], and while a behavioral description of disorder is
highly useful for clinical diagnosis, unfortunately the disorder groups defined by the manual do not map
onto biology [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>].
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   In order to address this mental health crisis, researchers would need data-driven, biologically-oriented
metrics associated with specific aberrant behavior and cognition. Toward this goal, the National Institute
of Mental Health (NIMH) founded the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) in 2009 [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. This initiative would
provide impetus for researchers to discover dimensions of genetic, neural, and behavioral features
underlying neuropsychiatric disorder and mental illness. The RDoC initiative defines seven domains under
which these different features can be studied, including cognition, social processes, arousal and regulatory
systems, along with negative and positive valence systems [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. This approach places an emphasis
on linking core cognitive and developmental processes to behavior and symptoms, holding
promise to redefine our definitions for mental illness to inspire better detection and prevention.
It follows, then, that filling in this matrix calls for approaches to link cognitive processes to
behavior.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Our understanding of human cognition comes from approaches that can measure biological and
cognitive variables during the live experience of one or more behaviors. Given these criteria, the primary
avenue for understanding human cognition has come from non-invasive brain imaging. We rely on
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to non-invasively study the human brain across
development, during the experience of different cognitive and behavioral tasks, and between different
DSM-defined behavior groups. However, neuroimaging technology, supplemented by expertise in cognitive
neuroscience, has been around for over two decades. Why, then, has cognitive neuroscience failed to
characterize mental illness?
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   A painful epiphany has been that&#x00A0;more attention has not been given to studying what it means,
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
computationally, to reproduce a result [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. Our ability to synthesize the compendium of research in
cognitive neuroscience relies primarily on meta analysis. Meta analysis across large datasets can provide
validation of the existence of functional brain networks linked to cognitive processes, consensus about how
different brain regions contribute to behavioral experience, and can lead to discovery of patterns that are
not revealed among the noise of smaller datasets. Thus, while we have confidence that cognitive
neuroscience has promise to better characterize mental illness, achieving this goal will require
more standardization and best practices for synthesizing results, which come in the form of
whole-brain statistical maps that reflect one or more cognitive processes of interest. Simply put,
we must have informed ways to link cognitive processes and behavior to our measurement of
it in functional brain imaging, and to compare a new claim to everything that came before
it.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   The responsibility to understand how similar one statistical brain map is to another, a procedure we
might call &#8220;image comparison,&#8221; along with the task of properly mapping cognitive processes to our
modality to measure them (fMRI) can be helped by Informatics. Informatics is a subset of science that
focuses on the infrastructure and methodology of a scientific discipline. Identifying informed methods to
assess the similarity of statistical brain maps, the most basic unit of output for neuroimaging scientists, is a
logical first step toward helping cognitive neuroscience. This need to understand best practices and explore
different strategies for image comparison motivates the work outlined in this thesis. My goal is to not only
study methods, but to provide tools and infrastructure to compare brain images to drive meta analysis and
relate cognitive processes to statistical brain maps. My approach consists of: 1) optimizing image
comparison to assess the similarity of statistical brain maps based on spatial transformations,
and 2) establishing novel semantic methods to drive image comparison based on cognitive
processes. For each of these steps, I develop tools and infrastructure to immediately deploy relevant
methods and empower researchers to compare their brain maps, and link fMRI to cognitive
processes. Such an approach will link behaviors and cognition to specific neural pathways,
allowing for a dimensional definition of these processes in the relevant domains of the RDoC
matrix.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   I will first show that there are optimal methods for spatial comparison of whole-brain statistical maps,
the first fundamental step of any meta-analysis. I identify pairwise comparison methods that are in line
with the goals of the researcher - optimal retrieval of maps from a particular experimental paradigm. This
simple method of deriving a similarity score from a thresholded image, and only comparing spatial
locations defined in both maps, results in 98.4% classification accuracy, and is robust across data derived
from different individuals and a wide array of experimental paradigms. This work sets up a best practice
for individual neuroimaging researchers to find &#8220;brain maps like mine,&#8221; and an informed basis for
developers of tools that assess the reproducibility of neuroimaging results based on spatial
information.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Next, I present work to suggest that semantic information about the cognitive tasks that give rise to
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
statistical brain maps can be useful in a classification framework. I will review automated and openly
available methods for semantic classification of statistical brain maps, and demonstrate that such a
comparison is comparable to the more commonly done calculation of spatial similarity. Adding a semantic
dimension, meaning ascribing terms like &#8220;positive feedback&#8221; and &#8220;working memory&#8221; to an image
comparison task is essential for several reasons. First, it brings a level of human interpretation to
this framework. Second, ontology development is a continually developing science, and it is
important to understand if effort in this domain is supported by the neuroimaging data that the
ontologies describe. Finally, adding a semantic dimension to image comparison means that brain
images derived from novel task structure can be interpreted, a procedure called &#8220;decoding&#8221;
that holds promise to predict the cognitive concepts associated with any &#8220;unknown&#8221; brain
map.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   As a supplement to this work, I include in this dissertation related work for standardization of
experimental paradigms used to measure behavior associated with an fMRI protocol (Appendix A), along
with a novel tool to visualize these functional networks (Appendix B). Finally, I will bring infrastructure
and methods together, discussing best practices and additional tools that I have developed
during my graduate career to empower neuroscience researchers to assess the reproducibility of
their work, and derive new reproducible products (Appendix C). This body of work, including
tools and methods for image comparison and reproducible neuroscience, provides compelling
example of both the strengths and challenges of the rising of informatics into the practice of
reproducible neuroscience. Cognitive neuroscience will not move forward quickly enough as a science,
bringing with it badly needed intervention for mental illness, if our researchers do not have better
tools. The work outlined in this thesis focuses on that goal, and is the first of its type to span
medical imaging expertise, machine learning and data visualization, as well as academic software
development.
