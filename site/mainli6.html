href="mainse2.html#x12-200012">Figure 1 from Salimi
et. al. that illustrates a 4-study, 1-dimensional meta-analysis. &#8220;A true signal (dashed
line) is created and four simulated statistic &#8216;images&#8217; are created by adding smoothed
white noise to the true signal (bold lines in the first column of the first four rows). To
apply CBMA to these simulated 1D studies, local maxima (foci) are extracted from each
observed signal (circles on the bold lines). Next, the locations of these foci are fed into
each CBMA technique. In the last row, the results of each method in reproducing the true
signal using the foci are shown. As can be seen, averaging over the complete signals (as
IBMA does) yields a better estimate of truth compared to using local maxima (CBMA).
ALE results in a smooth estimate (due to its Gaussian kernel) which KDA and MKDA
are rougher (due to its spherical kernel). Note that the &#8216;true&#8217; profile is generated as a
sum of Gaussian densities, which is most consistent with the ALE method.&#8221;</a></span><br /><span class="lofToc" >2.1&#x00A0;<a

generation and analysis process. A subset of 465 datasets from the Human Connectome
Project (subjects) is used to generate 47 contrast maps (group maps) for each of groups
A and B for 500 subsamples. Within each subsample, an unthresholded image from A is
compared with each thresholded image from B with a particular similarity metric and
comparison strategy applied. Each image from A is then assigned the predicted class for
the max. arg from the set of B, and accuracy is calculated for the subsample.</a></span><br /><span class="lofToc" >2.2&#x00A0;<a

Complete case analysis (CCA) with a Pearson score had a maximum accuracy of 0.984

href="mainse12.html#x24-490011">Overview of the approach.
Group statistical brain maps annotated with Cognitive Atlas concepts come from the
NeuroVault database (top left), and concept relationships are represented in the Cognitive
Atlas (bottom right). Spatial similarity is compared to purely semantic similarity using
representational similarity analysis (top right), and a classification encoding model is
used to test the predictive ability of semantic annotations (bottom right). An encoding
model is generated at each voxel to predict a vector of 93 image voxels (Y) using concept
labels (X) excluding two held out images, generating a vector of 132 coefficients (R)
for each of v voxels. These vectors can be assembled into a matrix (R) to generate a
predicted image (Yp) using a held out concept vector (Xn). </a></span><br /><span class="lofToc" >3.2&#x00A0;<a 
href="mainse13.html#x25-670012">Concepts associated
with correct and incorrect predictions. Regression parameters from the encoding model
reconstructed into brain maps to provide a visual understanding of what the model
learned, for concepts consistently associated with correct predictions (top row), and
associated with incorrect predictions (bottom row). Maps used in the classification task
included voxelwise data, and are thresholded above to show the highest positive (red)
and negative (blue) values.</a></span><br /><span class="lofToc" >3.3&#x00A0;<a 
href="mainse13.html#x25-690013">Comparison of semantic to spatial similarity. Semantic
image comparison is correlated with spatial image comparison (pearson score of 0.514
(95% confidence interval = (0.499,0.53), p-value &#x003C; 2.2e-16)) across all pairwise image
comparisons. Task and contrast specific RSA scores are included in Supplementary data
3.2.</a></span><br /><span class="lofToc" >A.1&#x00A0;<a
