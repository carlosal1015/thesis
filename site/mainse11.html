<!--l. 1125--><p class="noindent" >Statistical brain maps carry a wealth of information to inform our understanding of the human brain.
Underlying the matrix of numbers that is the most commonly utilized output of a neuroimaging analysis is
a resource that has yet to be shown to be useful: semantic knowledge. Computational approaches to
performing common investigations such as meta-analysis and assessment of reproducibility are the standard
because proper semantic annotation of this data is incredibly challenging if not totally unfeasible for large
data. &#x00A0;Given this challenge, it is not clear if semantic information about statistical brain maps can be
useful in a classification framework. &#x00A0;This semantic understanding&#x00A0;will improve the typical workflow of
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
the neuroimaging scientist by allowing them to immediately place any&#x00A0;statistical brain map
in the context of results that came before it, providing an intuitive transition from data and
knowledge.
<!--l. 1139--><p class="indent" >   Several barriers related to infrastructure and manpower have, to this day, existed to further complicate
this goal. First, results in the form of statistical brain maps have not been shared. This is changing with
public databases and openly available datasets [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? ? ? </span>], and so now it is very feasible to quickly share an
entire statistical map or full raw dataset. Further, integrated into some of these resources are application
programming interfaces (APIs) that serve to connect these data to other resources, allowing for automated,
integrated analysis. Of particular interest, and previously described is the Cognitive Atlas
[<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], an open-source knowledge-base that represents an understanding of cognitive processes,
experimental paradigms, and the relationships between them. This ontology has existed for over 11
years, and with substantial contribution from experts in the field, now has embedded detailed
relationships that are comprehensive enough to be useful for making inferences. It is now possible to
upload data to a database such as NeuroVault, tag the data with the specific measurement that
is represented by some comparison&#x00A0;over experimental conditions (called a &#8220;contrast&#8221;), and
programatically be able to make an association between the brain map and the cognitive concepts that it
represents.
<!--l. 1157--><p class="indent" >   In this work, I present the first ontologically-driven, automated semantic image comparison to
demonstrate that there is value in these semantic annotations. My approach is two-fold. I first
assess semantic comparison in a classification framework, using a multi-label machine learning
encoding model to predict brain images from cognitive concepts. I then use a graph metric
commonly utilized to assess the similarity of gene sets to compare brain statistical maps based
on cognitive concepts they are tagged with. I demonstrate with representational similarity
analysis that semantic image comparison is comparable to the more commonly done calculation
of spatial image comparison, the current standard. This work presents strong evidence for
the further development and use of such methods to assist in the larger goal of image-based
meta-analysis.
