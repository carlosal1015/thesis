<!--l. 207--><p class="noindent" >Functional brain imaging, as was previously stated, is the primary avenue to non-invasively study human
brain function that leads to behavior. Thus, understanding the basis of aberrant behavior to help the
mental health crisis is contingent upon synthesizing the compendium of neuroimaging work to make
associations between functional brain networks and cognitive processes. This synthesis is the first
action when the neuroimaging scientist obtains a new result, a statistical brain map with effect
sizes that reflect a cognitive process of interest. The goals of the researcher in this process are
many:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">use results from different studies to better understand a question of interest
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">accumulate evidence to gain statistical power
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">determine the association of a brain region to a task of interest (reverse inference)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">assess the probability or likelihood of a new result based on previous ones</li></ul>
<!--l. 230--><p class="indent" >   If a single result is simply a three dimensional matrix of numbers, the above tasks can be
understood as a &#8220;statistical pooling of information&#8221; [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. In fact, this is done on many levels in
neuroimaging science. When we want to understand how a group of individuals with some
phenotype may be different&#x00A0;in their brain function&#x00A0;from another group, we &#8220;pool&#8221; individual brain
maps into a group map to make higher level inferences [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. When we want to compare across
studies, we then &#8220;pool&#8221; these group maps to perform meta-analysis [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. To better understand
how these comparisons have been historically done, it is necessary to understand the influence
of the data that we decide to pool on the inferences that we can make, and specifically, the
tradeoff that is made between resolution of the meta-analysis and the interpretability of the
result.

<!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >This simple task of image comparison has flexibly adapted to match the availability of data. There are two
general approaches: coordinate-based meta analysis (CBMA), and image-based meta-analysis (IBMA).&#x00A0;A
brain map is a three dimensional matrix of numbers, where each x,y,z coordinate in this space, called a
&#8220;voxel&#8221; might hold a value that represents the result of a statistical test of interest for that location. To
standardize this coordinate space, the neuroimaging community has developed several standard &#8220;coordinate
spaces,&#8221; including Talaraich and MNI, the first being developed from a single individual [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], and the latter
a more proper probabilistic atlas derived from hundreds of individuals [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? ? </span>]. Having these standard
coordinates led to the reporting of results in papers by way of tables of coordinates (an example is
provided in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x12-130011">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:11 --></a>), with detail added about the coordinate being in Talaraich or MNI
space.

<!--l. 269--><p class="indent" >   Back in the early days when finding these &#8220;voxelwise&#8221; statistical map results on the internet was a
rarity, synthesizing results meant parsing these standardized coordinates from the papers to find
commonality of results. A coordinated effort to do this led to the development of the BrainMap database [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">?</span>
], a resource that has allowed for more than 500 publications at the time of writing this dissertation. Tools
such as GingerALE [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] to deploy a method called &#8220;activation likelihood estimation&#8221; [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] then empowered
researchers to manually enter significant coordinates across studies to summarize a set of interest.&#x00A0;The
requirement for manual entry of these results called for more automated approaches, and the
pioneering NeuroSynth [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>] made this possible. The NeuroSynth database is a publicly available
collection of coordinates that are automatically parsed from online neuroimaging literature. &#x00A0;While
BrainMap covers just over 2,700 papers, NeuroSynth has expanded to cover over 13,000 in
only five years. Given this expansive set of data, what methods are available to synthesize
it?

<!--l. 289--><p class="noindent" >Generally, CBMA approaches include quantitative analysis of specificity [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>], chi-square tests, analysis
of reported peak density differences, and pattern classification [<span

assessment of p-values to perform meta-analysis is useful for many domains of research [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>],
these methods proceed without the benefit of a key source of information, the spatial maps
themselves. I will first review CBMA methods, followed by IBMA. I will discuss the caveats of
these approaches, and how we must transition to a large-data, reproducible image comparison
framework.

class="ec-lmbx-10">Analysis of Reported Peak Density Differences</span></span>
   These approaches generally&#x00A0;map coordinate results&#x00A0;into a standard brain space to find areas of
significant overlap&#x00A0;with higher values, called &#8220;peaks.&#8221; These faux-maps are treated as representations of the
original spatial maps from which they were derived. A typical method might count peak activations in each
voxel, convolve the resulting histogram with a kernel (e.g., sphere or Gaussian), and compare
the result to some null distribution. The null hypothesis is that the distribution of peaks is
randomly and uniformly distributed. Thus, if the same general method is performed with randomly
placed points, this forms our null distribution for comparison. A method such as Monte Carlo
simulation might be used to calculate a p-value, and assess the significance of the difference
between the result and the null [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. Specific implementations of this process are derivations of
this general approach, using different kernels and final metrics for comparing the null to the
result.

 id="x12-160001.2.1"></a><span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">Kernel Density Analysis (KDA)</span></span>
   In KDA, the smoothing kernel applied to the data is spherical, typically with a radius of 10-15mm. A
value in a KDA map can be understood as the number of peaks within a radius of some R millimeters away
from the spatial location. These maps can be divided by the volume of the kernel to derive a
density in peaks per cubic millimeters. For KDA, we perform the procedure with randomly
placed points, and compare the top density value from the random points to our actual data [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">?</span>
].

 id="x12-170001.2.1"></a><span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE)</span></span>
   The ALE approach uses a Gaussian kernel, with width specified by a full width half maximum
(FWHM) value, such as 10 millimeters. In the ALE approach, a smoothed value in the map can be
understood as probabilities of each peak being within some R millimeters from the spatial location. The
union of these values is computed to derive the activation likelihood, the score of interest that is an
estimate of at least one peak activation being within the spatial location (&#8220;voxel&#8221;) of interest. Assessment
of significance means identifying the voxels where the union of probabilities is greater than chance
probability.

 id="x12-180001.2.1"></a><span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">Multi-level Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA)</span></span>
   In the MKDA approach, a single unit of analysis is a contrast map from a study.&#x00A0;The same procedure is
done as outlined previously, however instead of generating maps that reflect the frequency of activations,
the output is a binary &#8220;contrast indicator&#8221; map (a value of 1 indicates a peak within a radius of some R
millileters from a spatial location, and 0 not) that can be weighted by a metric relative to the study to
produce a density map, For example, the indicator maps could be weighted by study quality and
sample size to get a density map. The null hypothesis is that the distribution of peaks within
each contrast indicator map is randomly distributed, however the MKDA approach places
entire clusters (and not random points). A significant result then can be understood as finding
some proportion of the indicator map being consistently activated within R millimeters at a
rate greater than expected by chance [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. The benefit of MKDA is that it can be used to
compare two conditions, meaning doing the process separately with two different data sets, and
saving maximum values for the differences between the maps at each iteration of Monte Carlo
simulation. MKDA also improves upon ALE and KDA in that it has been shown empirically
to better control false positives. Thresholding on the distribution of saved differences then
creates a difference map. However, the results of these difference maps don&#8217;t say anything about
activation in the regions being associated with either of the contrasts, calling for a chi-squared
approach.

 id="x12-190001.2.1"></a><span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">Chi-Squared: NeuroSynth</span></span>
   The chi-squared approach allows for comparison of observed activation frequencies against a null
hypothesis. The best deployed example is via the NeuroSynth database. NeuroSynth collects and organizes
voxelwise coordinate data relevant to brain activity, and measures the association&#x00A0;between these
coordinates and terms from the paper&#x00A0;such as &#8220;anxiety&#8221; or &#8220;memory.&#8221; The automated approach is logical
to make the assumption that a publication related to the experience of &#8220;anxiety&#8221; is likely to have a high
frequency of mentions of the term.&#x00A0;The original NeuroSynth algorithm, for each spatial location in the
human brain, generated a 2x2 contingency table of counts to indicate if activation is present or absent
when a specific behavior term is present or absent. The current algorithm takes an approach similar to
KDA, first convolving the data with a 6mm sphere to smooth the activations spatially, and then
generating counts from this map. A Chi-Square test of independence is then used to determine
if there is a significant dependence between the term and activation, and p-values are false
discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted to account for multiple hypothesis testing at a threshold of
0.05 [<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]. The initial dataset relied upon parsing of full-text, publicly available manuscripts,
and the most recent version (<a 
href="https://github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth/releases/tag/0.3.3" >https://github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth/releases/tag/0.3.3</a>)
has transitioned to parsing more readily available abstracts and maintained the quality of the
result.
<!--l. 390--><p class="indent" >   These approaches make strong assumptions that studies do not differ in peaks reported, location,
smoothness, false positive rates, and statistical power. Specifically, for ALE and KDA, a single study with
many reports can highly influence the result, and we make the incorrect assumption that peaks are
independent within and across studies until the null. These approaches yield results with many false
positives, and further, we cannot infer from any of these results that repeating a study will produce
activation in the identified regions. While they have been useful, these drawbacks call for utilizing the
original spatial maps to drive the meta-analysis.

&#8220;A true signal (dashed line) is created and four simulated statistic &#8216;images&#8217; are created by adding
smoothed white noise to the true signal (bold lines in the first column of the first four rows). To
apply CBMA to these simulated 1D studies, local maxima (foci) are extracted from each observed
signal (circles on the bold lines). Next, the locations of these foci are fed into each CBMA technique.
In the last row, the results of each method in reproducing the true signal using the foci are shown.
As can be seen, averaging over the complete signals (as IBMA does) yields a better estimate of truth
compared to using local maxima (CBMA). ALE results in a smooth estimate (due to its Gaussian
kernel) which KDA and MKDA are rougher (due to its spherical kernel). Note that the &#8216;true&#8217; profile
is generated as a sum of Gaussian densities, which is most consistent with the ALE method.&#8221;</span></div><!--tex4ht:label?: x12-200012 -->

gold-standard IBMA uses large black dots to show local maxima that are reported in the whole-brain
maps. The second column shows results from ALE. The result is more of a curve because the ALE statistic
reflects a probability value that at least one peak is within some R millimeters of each voxel. The third
column is KDA, which gives us a value at each voxel that represents the number of peaks within R
millimeters of that voxel, and dividing by the voxel resolution gives us a &#8220;density.&#8221; Finally, the last
column is MKDA, which is the same as KDA, but the procedure is done for each study, and the
resulting &#8220;contrast indicator maps&#8221; indicate the presence or absence of a peak within some R
millimeters.

how KDA, ALE, and MKDA perform on just the single &#8220;study&#8221; data, and the last row shows
how the methods perform for meta-analysis across all the studies. The figure shows that the
IBMA (averaging over the images) produces a signal that is closest to the original data, an
improvement over the CBMA approaches. This investigation sets up compelling evidence that
even a simple metric that utilizes the entire spatial map is an improvement over traditional
CBMA approaches, and encourages the field to move in that direction. In fact, the paper is quite
foretelling:
