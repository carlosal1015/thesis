<!--l. 538--><p class="noindent" >To move forward, we must be able to develop methods for informed comparison of brain maps that result
from these experiments. This means a collaborative process of developing, deploying, and making assertions
about the cognitive concepts that an experiment aims to measure, followed up with discussion and
validation of those assertions in the data being collected. Success in this process calls for convergence in the
methods used to compare images, integration with standard terminologies, and robust annotation of data
associated with experiments. However, before we can invest in this approach, we must be confident that
making any such assertions is useful to meet the goals of the researcher attempting to synthesize
what we understand about the human brain. Specifically, this approach must add value to
performing a meta-analysis over functional neuroimaging data. Unfortunately, best practices
for spatial comparison of images, let alone semantic comparison using standard terminology
associated with particular experiments, is poorly studied. Ideally, these two feature spaces
would be in agreement, and we could better harness both spatial and semantic features to make
inferences about the cognitive processes underlying behaviors that emerge from the human
brain.
