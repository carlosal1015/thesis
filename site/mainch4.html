<!--l. 1719--><p class="noindent" >In this dissertation, I have reviewed convergent methods for spatial and semantic image comparison of
brain imaging data, and provided a direct means to map cognitive processes onto statistical brain maps. I
start with a body of work to better define standard comparison methods in the domain of cognitive
imaging, presenting work to identify optimal methods for spatial comparison of whole-brain statistical
maps (Chapter 2). This is the &#8220;spatial&#8221; component of this dissertation work, and is a powerful example of
comparison methods that are in line with the goals of the researcher performing a meta-analysis.
Chapter 3 addresses the &#8220;semantic&#8221; feature space, demonstrating clear value in integrating
standard terminology about cognitive processes to drive image comparison for meta-analysis.

<!--l. 1729--><p class="indent" >   Integrated into these tools I have deployed my research findings by way of methods and prototypes that
have real extendable, usable, value. Through methods and tools, this work sets up a basic
framework for researchers to conduct meta-analysis to assess the replication of a brain statistical
map. This is essential to better synthesize and grow our understanding of the function of the
human brain to aid the mental health crisis. It was not known before this work if semantic
annotations had value for the assessment of similarity of whole brain statistical maps. This
work sets up rationale and infrastructure for the growth of an entire new domain: applying
methods from graph theory not on the imaging data itself, but on the semantic annotations
associated with it. These semantic annotations are reliably linked to the experiments by way of the
Cognitive Atlas, bringing badly needed standardization for development and deployment of these
paradigms.
<!--l. 1741--><p class="indent" >   Underlying this work is my deepest desire to push forward the need for academic software developers
and optimal methods and infrastructure for reproducible science. Building tools that are integrated with
sound methods, and that are easy to use, is essential for data science to help the human condition. It is
with great anticipation that I look forward to pursuing this path to build tools that have impact in the
next stage of my career.
