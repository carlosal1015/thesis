<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >I had a challenging early start to graduate school. I started on a path of trying to fit my research into the
aims of others, feeling rushed to meet milestones and painfully aware of losing touch with the aspects of
research that brought me there in the first place. It was a life changing event when Russell Poldrack
brought his lab to Stanford in the Fall of 2014. For the first time I was immersed in my field, learning
enormous things from the people around me, and part of a larger, shared vision. Thus, I am eternally
grateful to my advisor, Russ Poldrack, for supporting me, connecting me with my niche, and providing a
rich environment for me to flourish. I am grateful to Chris Gorgolewski for showing me an example of
prowess in methods, software development, and sheer attention to detail. I had never before encountered a
group that supported and found great value in my drive to build tools similar to mine, and this
helped me to gain confidence in my own vision for how I wanted to be. I am grateful to my
labmates Sanmi Koyejo, Craig Moodie, Ian Eisenberg, Patrick Bissett, Mac Shine, Zeynep Enkavi,
and Joke Durnez for their support, humor, and advice. I found everything that I had always
wanted in Poldrack Lab, and it has given me the foundation to be a better problem solver,
communicator, and overall researcher. With such a foundation, there is no feat I am afraid to pursue,
and I am ready to aggressively pursue building the applications that I&#8217;ve only dreamed of,
continually push myself into challenges and learning new things, and contribute meaningfully to
science.
