   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">B.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x38-115000B.2.1"></a>Parcellation and connectivity matrix generation</h4>
<!--l. 2409--><p class="noindent" >Functional imaging data was provided by the MyConnectome project (<a 
href="http://www.myconnectome.org" >http://www.myconnectome.org</a>), for
which all data, processing protocol, and code is publicly available through a standard data sharing
agreement. For this prototype, a mean connectivity matrix from an individual was derived from all resting
BOLD scans. A parcellation procedure ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]) was used to define 565 distinct regions, each of which was used
to mask the data to define timecourses. Pearson correlation was used to generate the connectivity matrix,
M, [565 x 565].

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">B.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x38-116000B.2.2"></a>Interface development</h4>
<!--l. 2412--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x38-117000B.2.2"></a>Web technology</h5>
<!--l. 2413--><p class="noindent" >Data Driven Documents, &#8220;D3&#8221; is a JavaScript library based on web standards (HTML, SVG, and CSS) ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">?</span>
]) that allows for generation of interactive, web visualizations. This technology was selected for development
of this interface due to integration with multiple platforms and browser types, as well as the utilization of
scalable vector graphics (SVG) to drive the visualization. A SVG is a vector based graphic, meaning that it
is well-suited for publication, and the graphic could be exported from the interface for this
purpose.
<!--l. 2415--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x38-118000B.2.2"></a>Visualization Strategy</h5>
<!--l. 2416--><p class="noindent" >The goals of the brain visualization were to provide a two-dimensional rendition of a brain that maintained
anatomical spatial accuracy in its representation. First, I created a matrix of parcel x,y,z coordinates, C
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
(565 x 3) and calculated the Euclidean distances between coordinates, resulting in a distance matrix,
Cd, of size (565 x 565). I then used the cmdscale function in R ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]) to transform the three
dimensional matrix into two-dimensions. MDS is a method for dimensionality reduction that can
visualize any N dimensional dataset in fewer dimensions, allowing for projection of the three
dimensional coordinates onto a two-dimensional plane. The algorithm works by placing each of the
three-dimensional points in such a way so that similarity between points is preserved in distances
([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]). This resulted in a flat axial image of brain coordinates onto which connections can be
mapped.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x38-119000B.2.2"></a>Data Filtering</h5>
<!--l. 2419--><p class="noindent" >Portrayal of all 565 x 565 = 319,225 connectivity values in the matrix would generate a slow visualization,
and so it was decided to threshold values to include the top 1% of both positive and negative values using
the &#8220;quantile&#8221; function in R ([<span 
class="ec-lmbx-10">? </span>]) for a total of N=3,914.
<!--l. 2421--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">B.2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x38-120000B.2.3"></a>Design choices</h4>
<!--l. 2422--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x38-121000B.2.3"></a>Coloring, thickness, and size</h5>
<!--l. 2423--><p class="noindent" >The parcels that form the two-dimensional brain mapping are each colored by the functional network to
which they belong, and this coloring is consistent with a set of large buttons above the brain that the user
can click to turn &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221; a particular network. The links are colored with a gradient, so in the case of
a connection between parcels from different networks, the color transitions seamlessly. The node size
changes dynamically to reflect the number of connections to it, and the viewer can click on nodes to
highlight connections.
<!--l. 2425--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x38-122000B.2.3"></a>Dimensionality</h5>
<!--l. 2426--><p class="noindent" >The next challenge was orienting the viewer in a three-dimensional space with a two-dimensional image. A
simple strategy was utilized that, upon moving the cursor over any particular parcel on the brain
map, shows the viewer an axial orthogonal slice with a bright red spot to indicate the parcel
location.
                                                                                   

                                                                                   
<!--l. 2428--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x38-123000B.2.3"></a>Data Values</h5>
<!--l. 2429--><p class="noindent" >An interface cluttered with data values can distract the viewer, and so &#8220;tooltips,&#8221; or boxes of information
that appear upon moving the cursor over an object in the visualization, were utilized to give feedback on
links strengths, and node x,y,z coordinates.
<!--l. 2431--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x38-124000B.2.3"></a>Interface Controls</h5>
<!--l. 2432--><p class="noindent" >The main control panel, including buttons to turn links associated with networks &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221; and a slider
to threshold the connectivity value, is placed above the brain map for easy accessibility. Dynamically
changing summary statistics (mean, min, max, counts) are on the left panel. The right panel includes image
export options. The finished prototype is available at <a
