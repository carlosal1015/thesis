<!--l. 2297--><p class="noindent" >I have developed the Experiment Factory with a vision of open, collaborative science. The modular
application is flexible to be used by both developers and researchers without development experience,
and structured so that experiments must follow guidelines that will make them extendable to
multiple frameworks. I have integrated the Cognitive Atlas as a way to provide structure in
making assertions about what the experiments measure - any experiment tagged with a unique
identifier in the Cognitive Atlas can immediately be compared to other experiments on the
level of the cognitive concepts. While I am optimistic about this approach, there are several
limitations.

 id="x34-100000A.5.1"></a>Software Versioning</h4>
<!--l. 2310--><p class="noindent" >A key challenge with any kind of deployment of this nature is software versioning. For example, the
current experiments and battery are up to date with the most recent version of the JsPsych
library, and upgrading this software would require developers to update current experiments.
Thus, a standard in software development is to instill that care is taken to make available
different versions of the software to support legacy implementations. Significant new releases
of dependencies can be integrated when the developer community decides they are needed,
and these same developers take responsibility for ensuring proper function of components.
This is the rationale for Continuous Integration to run tests of the function of software, which
has been implemented and provided by way of CircleCI (www.circleci.com) integration with
Github.

 id="x34-101000A.5.2"></a>Ontology Development</h4>
<!--l. 2325--><p class="noindent" >The Cognitive Atlas may not contain every experimental paradigm that would be desired, and so it might
be required for a researcher to add a new experiment, extend documentation on an already defined
experiment, or better develop the assertions about the cognitive concepts that the task measures. Ontology
development is an ongoing process.

 id="x34-102000A.5.3"></a>Operating Systems and Browsers Supported</h4>
<!--l. 2332--><p class="noindent" >The Experiment Factory experiments have been tested fully on Chrome and Firefox browsers running on
Linux and Mac OS systems. While there is a plan to develop a desktop application that will have cross
platform support (i.e., including Windows), this desktop application is not yet available. In the meantime
users are encouraged to use the tools on Linux and Mac OS, in Chrome or Firefox, and to use a virtual
machine for support on Windows systems.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">A.5.4   </span> <a 
 id="x34-103000A.5.4"></a>Future Development</h4>
<!--l. 2342--><p class="noindent" >The Experiment Factory aims to keep the various components and experiments modern. I believe that the
same technology available and used in industry should be extended to researchers, and for this reason have
chosen the current approach that uses modern technologies such as Docker, Amazon Mechanical Turk,
and Amazon Web Services. Coinciding with this goal, I see a potential opportunity to deploy
experiments via social networks such as Facebook, and have plans to develop this ability. I have also
developed an easy deployment of a text file with survey questions to allow easy deployment of
browser-based surveys (expfactory-surveys). This is an important contribution as I believe the
JsPsych framework is an overly complex solution for the administration of simple form data. I
see great potential in the development of experiments beyond the jsPsych framework, and
have extended a collaboration to the lab of Vinod Menon at Stanford to use the framework to
deploy the first browser-based game. Given the open nature of this work, I encourage and invite
all researchers to join in the development of experiments, battery template, and deployment
infrastructures.
