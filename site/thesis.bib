Here we evaluate a simple measure of semantic similarity, term overlap (TO).",

                 resonance imaging was used to examine whether separate LIPC
                 regions participate in each of these types of processing.
                 Performance of a semantic decision task resulted in extensive
                 LIPC activation compared to a perceptual control task.
                 Phonological processing of words and pseudowords in a
                 syllable-counting task resulted in activation of the dorsal
                 aspect of the left inferior frontal gyrus near the inferior
                 frontal sulcus (BA 44/45) compared to a perceptual control

                 In a direct comparison of semantic and phonological tasks,
                 semantic processing preferentially activated the ventral

                   reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance
                   to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike.
                   Though computational reproducibility seems more straight
                   forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex

                   challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code
                   developed for one research project cannot be successfully
                   executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review
                   current approaches to these issues, including virtual
                   machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then
                   examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines
                   several areas from systems research - such as operating
                   system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular

                 involved in stuttered speech as in fluent speech, but with
                 some important differences. Motor areas were over-activated in
                 stuttering, including primary motor cortex, supplementary

               Investigating Brain Disorders. Part 1: The Review Articles",
  author    = "Horwitz, Barry and Horovitz, Silvina G",
  abstract  = "In the past few years, advances in human structural and
               functional neuroimaging, especially with respect to magnetic
               resonance imaging, have resulted in an explosion of studies
               exploring the anatomical and functional connectivities between
               different regions of the brain. More and more studies have
               employed resting and task‐related connectivity analyses to
               assess functional interactions, and other studies have used
               diffusion‐weighted tractography to examine the organization and
               integrity of white matter tracts. Many of these studies have
               addressed normal human function, but recently, a number of
               investigators have turned their attention to examining brain
               disorders. We are on the verge of being able to better
               understand the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric
               disorders and the effect of treatments on brain function. The
               study of brain disorders is a complex endeavor: not only does it
               require understanding the normal brain, and the regions involved
               in a particular function, but also it needs a deeper
               understanding of brain networks and their dynamics. Moreover, in
               many cases, disorders are progressive, and thus imaging could
               potentially become a source of biomarkers for early detection
               and assessment of the course of a disease (Horwitz and Rowe,
               2011), and for evaluating potential treatments. The articles
               that appear in this Special Topics ebook represent the current
               status of the applications that employ brain connectivity
               analysis to investigate brain disorders. Although certain types
               of connectivity analyses have become very popular recently
               (e.g., resting state fMRI functional connectivity -- see the
               Special Topics issue of Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience edited
               by Uddin and Menon (2010)), we have chosen to cover articles
               that represent the broadest possible set of connectivity
               methods, employing the widest possible spectrum of imaging
               techniques, and applied to the full range of neurological,
               psychiatric and developmental disorders. In this way, we hope
               that readers acquire an understanding of how these relatively
               new connectivity analysis methods enable investigators to
               address brain disorders from a network perspective. Even
               pathology localized to one area of the brain can lead to
               dysfunctional network behavior, since no brain region is an
               island onto itself. The insights offered by the network paradigm
               have, therefore, important ramifications for using neuroimaging
               to help detect and diagnose brain disorders, interpret the
               symptoms of many disorders, and assess potential treatments.Two
               types of articles comprise this Special Topics ebook -- review
               articles and papers that include primarily the results of
               original research. Here, we provide a brief overview of the
               review articles. See the Horovitz and Horwitz editorial
               (Introduction to Research Topic Brain Connectivity Analysis:
               Investigating Brain Disorders, Part 2: Original Research
               Articles) for a corresponding overview of the research papers.
               The review articles can be roughly divided into (1) those that
               focus on a connectivity method, and use one or more disorders to
               illustrate the method, and (2) those whose emphasis is placed on
               a particular disorder, and discuss a number of relevant
               functional and structural connectivity studies investigating the
               disorder. In the first category of reviews, Rowe (2010) provides
               an overview of fMRI-based functional and effective connectivity,
               with a focus on its applications to neurological disorders. One
               of the most widely used effective connectivity techniques is
               Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) (Friston et al., 2003), and
               Seghier and colleagues (2010) present an extensive review of its
               application to all brain disorders. This article also includes a
               useful introduction to Bayesian model selection (Penny et al.,
               2004), a key component of DCM. Another ``functional''
               connectivity method that has been applied to investigate brain
               disorders is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and the
               article by Hampson and Hoffman (2010) contains a nice overview
               of the method, along with a review of its applications to
               psychiatric and neurological disorders. In TMS, an externally
               applied changing magnetic field is used to induce electrical
               stimulation in a cortical brain area which propagates through
               long-range connections to other brain regions. David and
               colleagues (2010) discuss a similar method, direct electrical
               stimulation (DES), applied using intracranial electrodes in some
               epileptic patients during presurgical evaluation prior to
               epileptogenic tissue resection. DES is applied directly to
               cortical tissue and tracts with extremely well-defined spatial
               definition, and in this sense, it provides human data that are
               unattainable by any other method. Epilepsy also provides the
               basis for two other reviews. Wendling et al. (2010) discuss a
               variety of functional connectivity techniques that have been
               applied to electrophysiological data obtained from scalp and
               intracerebral EEG recordings, whereas the review by Lemieux and
               colleagues (2011) offers a broad overview of both EEG-based and
               fMRI-based functional and effective connectivity analyses.
               Finally, Alexander-Bloch and collaborators (2010) provide a
               useful overview of the basic concepts and mathematics of graph
               theory as applied to fMRI resting data. As an example of graph
               theory as applied to resting state fMRI, they present results of
               a study comparing childhood-onset schizophrenia with normal
               controls, showing disrupted modularity and local connectivity in
               the patients. The second category of review articles focuses on
               disorders. Schipul et al. (2011) provide a detailed review of
               autism. In many ways autism represents the classic example of a
               disorder where analyses of imaging data at the single brain
               region level yielded very little insight, but network analyses
               have proven quite fruitful in furthering our understanding of
               the condition. A second brain disorder that is reviewed here is
               coma (and related disorders of consciousness). Noirhomme et al.
               (2010) show that such studies can shed important light on what
               mediates conscious awareness. Two articles address stroke, in
               particular focusing on using brain connectivity analyses to
               assess functional recovery. Westlake and Nagarajan (2011)
               provide an overview of functional connectivity in relation to
               motor performance. Their review emphasizes PET, fMRI and EEG/MEG
               studies. In the other review, Johansen-Berg et al. (2010)
               examine white matter connectivity results, obtained using
               diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Their paper includes information
               on how this technique can be used to test for dynamic changes in
               structural connectivity with learning or with recovery from the
               effects of a stroke.",

  abstract = "Historically, reproducibility has been the sine qua non of
              experimental findings that are considered to be scientifically
              useful. Typically, findings from functional magnetic resonance
              imaging (fMRI) studies are assessed with statistical parametric
              maps (SPMs) using a p value threshold. However, a smaller p value
              does not imply that the observed result will be reproducible. In
              this study, we suggest interpreting SPMs in conjunction with
              reproducibility evidence. Reproducibility is defined as the
              extent to which the active status of a voxel remains the same
              across replicates conducted under the same conditions. We propose
              a methodology for assessing reproducibility in functional MR
              images without conducting separate experiments. Our procedures
              include the empirical Bayes method for estimating effects due to
              experimental stimuli, the threshold optimization procedure for
              assigning voxels to the active status, and the construction of
              reproducibility maps. In an empirical example, we implemented the
              proposed methodology to construct reproducibility maps based on
              data from the study by Ishai et al. (2000). The original
              experiments involved 12 human subjects and investigated brain
              regions most responsive to visual presentation of 3 categories of
              objects: faces, houses, and chairs. The brain regions identified
              included occipital, temporal, and fusiform gyri. Using our
              reproducibility analysis, we found that subjects in one of the
              experiments exercised at least 2 mechanisms in responding to
              visual objects when performing alternately matching and passive
              tasks. One gave activation maps closer to those reported in Ishai
              et al., and the other had related regions in the precuneus and
              posterior cingulate. The patterns of activated regions are
              reproducible for at least 4 out of 6 subjects involved in the
              experiment. Empirical application of the proposed methodology
              suggests that human brains exhibit different strategies to
              accomplish experimental tasks when responding to stimuli. It is
              important to correlate activations to subjects' behavior such as
              reaction time and response accuracy. Also, the latency between
              the stimulus presentation and the peak of the hemodynamic
              response function varies considerably among individual subjects
              according to types of stimuli and experimental tasks. These
              variations per se also deserve scientific inquiries. We conclude
              by discussing research directions relevant to reproducibility

                 of intrinsic brain networks--a novel and burgeoning research
                 field--is limited by the lack of ground truth and the tendency
                 of analyses to overfit the data. Independent Component
                 Analysis (ICA) is commonly used to separate the data into
                 signal and Gaussian noise components, and then map these
                 components on to spatial networks. Identifying noise from this
                 data, however, is a tedious process that has proven hard to
                 automate, particularly when data from different institutions,
                 subjects, and scanners is used. Here we present an automated
                 method to delineate noisy independent components in ICA using
                 a data-driven infrastructure that queries a database of 246
                 spatial and temporal features to discover a computational
                 signature of different types of noise. We evaluated the
                 performance of our method to detect noisy components from
                 healthy control fMRI (sensitivity = 0.91, specificity = 0.82,
                 cross validation accuracy (CVA) = 0.87, area under the curve
                 (AUC) = 0.93), and demonstrate its generalizability by showing
                 equivalent performance on (1) an age- and scanner-matched
                 cohort of schizophrenia patients from the same institution
                 (sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.83, CVA = 0.86), (2) an
                 age-matched cohort on an equivalent scanner from a different
                 institution (sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.88, CVA =
                 0.88), and (3) an age-matched cohort on a different scanner
                 from a different institution (sensitivity = 0.72, specificity
                 = 0.92, CVA = 0.79). We additionally compare our approach with
                 a recently published method. Our results suggest that our

               of the small variations that are beyond the control of the
               experimental biologist or physicist. However, in reality,
               computational science has its own challenges for
               reproducibility: many computational scientists find it difficult
               to reproduce results published in the literature, and many
               authors have met problems replicating even the figures in their

               range of analyses in neuroimaging, from decoding to
               meta-analysis. In many cases the images being compared have
               empty voxels, but the effects of such empty voxels on image
               similarity metrics are poorly understood. We present a detailed
               investigation of the influence of different degrees of image
               thresholding on the outcome of pairwise image comparison. Given
               a pair of brain maps for which one of the maps is thresholded,
               we show that an analysis using the intersection of nonzero
               voxels across images at a threshold of Z = +/- 1.0 maximizes
               accuracy for retrieval of a list of maps of the same contrast,
               and thresholding up to Z = +/- 2.0 can increase accuracy as
               compared to comparison using unthresholded maps. Finally, maps
               can be thresholded up to to Z = +/- 3.0 (corresponding to 25\%
               of voxels non-empty within a standard brain mask) and still
               maintain a lower bound of 90\% accuracy. Our results suggest

                 neuroimaging studies of working memory has been the n-back
                 task, in which subjects are asked to monitor the identity or
                 location of a series of verbal or nonverbal stimuli and to
                 indicate when the currently presented stimulus is the same as
                 the one presented n trials previously. We conducted a
                 quantitative meta-analysis of 668 sets of activation
                 coordinates in Talairach space reported in 24 primary studies
                 of n-back task variants manipulating process (location vs.
                 identity monitoring) and content (verbal or nonverbal) of
                 working memory. We found the following cortical regions were
                 activated robustly (voxelwise false discovery rate = 1\%):
                 lateral premotor cortex; dorsal cingulate and medial premotor
                 cortex; dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex;
                 frontal poles; and medial and lateral posterior parietal
                 cortex. Subsidiary meta-analyses based on appropriate subsets
                 of the primary data demonstrated broadly similar activation
                 patterns for identity monitoring of verbal stimuli and both
                 location and identity monitoring of nonverbal stimuli. There
                 was also some evidence for distinct frontoparietal activation

                 QUANTITATIVELY RELATE ITS THREE MAJOR BRANCHES OF RESEARCH:
                 brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and
                 computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns
                 to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the
                 need to define the correspondency between the units of the
                 model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g.,
                 single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic
                 resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems
                 complicate relating activity patterns between different
                 modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and
                 invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and
                 species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest
                 abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and
                 computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs),
                 which characterize the information carried by a given
                 representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich
                 psychological and mathematical literature on similarity
                 analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical
                 framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA),
                 in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are
                 quantitatively related to each other and to computational
                 theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by
                 relating representations of visual objects as measured with
                 fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to
                 computational models spanning a wide range of complexities.
                 The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level
                 application of multidimensional scaling and tested using
                 randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad
                 potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental
                 design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in
                 psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated
                 quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus
                 contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.",

                 METHOD: Data were obtained from a community sample (N=5,856)
                 of lifetime drinkers participating in the 1990-1991 Mental
                 Health Supplement of the Ontario Health Survey. RESULTS:
                 Survival analyses revealed a rapid progression to
                 alcohol-related harm among those who reported having their
                 first drink at ages 11-14. After 10 years, 13.5\% of the
                 subjects who began to drink at ages 11 and 12 met the criteria
                 for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, and 15.9\% had a diagnosis
                 of dependence. Rates for subjects who began to drink at ages
                 13 and 14 were 13.7\% and 9.0\%, respectively. In contrast,
                 rates for those who started drinking at ages 19 and older were
                 2.0\% and 1.0\%. Unexpectedly, a delay in progression to harm
                 was observed for the youngest drinkers (ages 10 and under).
                 Hazard regression analyses revealed a nonlinear effect of age
                 at first alcohol use, marked by an elevated risk of developing
                 disorders among subjects first using alcohol at ages 11-14.
                 CONCLUSIONS: First use of alcohol at ages 11-14 greatly
                 heightens the risk of progression to the development of
                 alcohol disorders and therefore is a reasonable target for
                 intervention strategies that seek to delay first use as a
                 means of averting problems later in life.",

                 region. However, even when consistent signal changes are
                 identified, they are likely to be due to nearby vessels, most
                 notably the basal vein of rosenthal (BVR). Using an
                 accelerated fMRI sequence with a high temporal resolution (TR
                 = 333 ms) combined with susceptibility-weighted imaging, we
                 show how signal changes in the amygdala region can be related
                 to a venous origin. This finding is confirmed here in both a
                 conventional fMRI dataset (TR = 2000 ms) as well as in
                 information of meta-analyses, implying that ``amygdala
                 activations'' reported in typical fMRI studies are likely
                 confounded by signals originating in the BVR rather than in
                 the amygdala itself, thus raising concerns about many
                 conclusions on the functioning of the amygdala that rely on
                 fMRI evidence alone.",

                 the scientific mainstream. Because of this rapid growth, there
                 is a great need to effectively collect and synthesize the body
                 of literature in this field. The BrainMap database was created
                 in response to this need as an electronic environment for
                 modeling the human brain through quantitative meta-analysis of
                 the brain mapping literature. BrainMap was originally
                 conceived in 1987 and has received continuous funding from
                 1988 to 2004. During this time, BrainMap has consistently

                 accumulation of neuroinformatic databases the synthesis of
                 consensus findings using meta-analysis is becoming
                 increasingly important. Meta-analyses pool data across many
                 studies to identify reliable experimental effects and
                 characterize the degree of agreement across studies.
                 Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard
                 approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has
                 been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak
                 activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in
                 published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods
                 use the full statistic images, and allow the use of
                 hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing
                 intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study
                 variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based
                 and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same
                 dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify
                 the information lost by working only with the coordinates of
                 peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We
                 apply a 3-level IBMA mixed model for a ``mega-analysis'', and
                 highlight important considerations in the specification of
                 each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three
                 CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA
                 (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density
                 analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the
                 datasets considered, we find that ALE at sigma=15 mm, KDA at
                 rho=25-30 mm and MKDA at rho=15 mm give the greatest
                 similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most
                 similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice
                 similarity coefficient of 0.45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to
                 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling
                 flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest
                 that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses
                 practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an
                 effective mechanism for sharing image data, including
                 whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard

                 behavior, as subjects stop certain responses or responses to
                 certain stimuli. The literature has discussed 2 strategies for
                 selective stopping. First, selective stopping may prolong the
                 stop process by adding a discrimination stage (Independent
                 Discriminate then Stop). Second, selective stopping may
                 involve stopping nonselectively and then restarting the
                 response if the signal is an ignore signal (Stop then
                 Discriminate). We discovered a variant of the first strategy
                 that occurred often in our experiments and previously
                 published experiments: The requirement to discriminate stop
                 and ignore signals may interact with the go process,
                 invalidating the independent race model (Dependent
                 Discriminate then Stop). Our experiments focused on stimulus
                 selective stopping, in which subjects stop to one signal and
                 ignore another. When stop and ignore signals were equally
                 likely, some subjects used the Stop then Discriminate strategy
                 and others used the Dependent Discriminate then Stop strategy.
                 When stop signals were more frequent than ignore signals, most
                 subjects used the Stop then Discriminate strategy; when ignore
                 signals were more frequent than stop signals, most subjects

                 commonly accepted Independent Discriminate then Stop strategy
                 was seldom implemented. Selective stopping was either not
                 selective (Stop then Discriminate), or interacted with going
                 (Dependent Discriminate then Stop). Implications for the

  abstract    = "A widely used technique for coordinate-based meta-analysis of
                 neuroimaging data is activation likelihood estimation (ALE),
                 which determines the convergence of foci reported from
                 different experiments. ALE analysis involves modelling these
                 foci as probability distributions whose width is based on
                 empirical estimates of the spatial uncertainty due to the
                 between-subject and between-template variability of
                 neuroimaging data. ALE results are assessed against a
                 null-distribution of random spatial association between
                 experiments, resulting in random-effects inference. In the
                 present revision of this algorithm, we address two remaining
                 drawbacks of the previous algorithm. First, the assessment of
                 spatial association between experiments was based on a highly
                 time-consuming permutation test, which nevertheless entailed
                 the danger of underestimating the right tail of the
                 null-distribution. In this report, we outline how this
                 previous approach may be replaced by a faster and more precise
                 analytical method. Second, the previously applied correction
                 procedure, i.e. controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), is
                 supplemented by new approaches for correcting the family-wise
                 error rate and the cluster-level significance. The different
                 alternatives for drawing inference on meta-analytic results
                 are evaluated on an exemplary dataset on face perception as
                 well as discussed with respect to their methodological
                 limitations and advantages. In summary, we thus replaced the
                 previous permutation algorithm with a faster and more rigorous
                 analytical solution for the null-distribution and
                 comprehensively address the issue of multiple-comparison
                 corrections. The proposed revision of the ALE-algorithm should
                 provide an improved tool for conducting coordinate-based

                 'reverse inference', by which the engagement of a particular

                 vocabularies, such as Gene Ontology (GO)
                 (http://www.geneontology.org), address the need for consistent
                 descriptions of genes in different data sources, there is
                 still no effective method to determine the functional
                 similarities of genes based on gene annotation information
                 from heterogeneous data sources. RESULTS: To address this
                 critical need, we proposed a novel method to encode a GO
                 term's semantics (biological meanings) into a numeric value by
                 aggregating the semantic contributions of their ancestor terms
                 (including this specific term) in the GO graph and, in turn,
                 designed an algorithm to measure the semantic similarity of GO
                 terms. Based on the semantic similarities of GO terms used for
                 gene annotation, we designed a new algorithm to measure the
                 functional similarity of genes. The results of using our
                 algorithm to measure the functional similarities of genes in
                 pathways retrieved from the saccharomyces genome database
                 (SGD), and the outcomes of clustering these genes based on the

                 cognitive demands. One task that is well-suited to explore
                 control adjustments is the stop-signal paradigm, in which
                 subjects must balance initiation and inhibition. One common
                 adjustment in the stop-signal paradigm is post-stop-signal
                 slowing. Existing models of sequential adjustments in the
                 stop-signal paradigm suggest that post-stop-signal slowing may
                 be based solely on the events of the previous trial,
                 suggesting that post-stop-signal slowing is a reflexive
                 byproduct of a stop signal. Alternatively, post-stop-signal
                 slowing could be the result of implicit learning or strategic
                 adjustment. The authors report three experiments that
                 manipulated the probability of stop trial repetition and found
                 that these contingencies eliminate, reverse, or greatly
                 increase post-stop-signal slowing. When the contingency was
                 not instructed or cued, modest adjustments of post-stop-signal
                 slowing occurred, suggesting implicit learning. When the
                 contingency was cued, performance adjustments occurred on the
                 next trial, suggesting that strategies dominated
                 post-stop-signal slowing. These results show that
                 post-stop-signal slowing is not a reflexive byproduct of the
                 stop signal. The large changes in strategy accompany large

               classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness (CT)
               extraction, using three of the main neuroimaging packages (FSL,
               Freesurfer and CIVET) and different versions of GNU/Linux. We
               also identify some causes of these differences using library and
               system call interception. We find that these packages use
               mathematical functions based on single-precision floating-point
               arithmetic whose implementations in operating systems continue
               to evolve. While these differences have little or no impact on
               simple analysis pipelines such as brain extraction and cortical
               tissue classification, their accumulation creates important
               differences in longer pipelines such as subcortical tissue
               classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness
               extraction. With FSL, most Dice coefficients between subcortical
               classifications obtained on different operating systems remain
               above 0.9, but values as low as 0.59 are observed. Independent
               component analyses (ICA) of fMRI data differ between operating
               systems in one third of the tested subjects, due to differences
               in motion correction. With Freesurfer and CIVET, in some brain
               regions we find an effect of build or operating system on
               cortical thickness. A first step to correct these
               reproducibility issues would be to use more precise
               representations of floating-point numbers in the critical

                 The movement plan for the second response may inhibit the

                 into connectivity within the whole-brain functional network

                 local connectivity properties of the functional connectome.
                 Beyond ``detecting functional hubs,'' we treat centrality as

  abstract    = "Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration
                 of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional
                 neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the
                 development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad
                 functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a
                 priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI)
                 constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this
                 challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals
                 large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz)
                 fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated
                 across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional
                 connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of
                 complex neural systems, collectively constituting an
                 individual's ``functional connectome.'' Reproducibility across
                 datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome
                 has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional
                 connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful
                 interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and
                 strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome,
                 and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences
                 and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter
                 collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by
                 gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected
                 independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a
                 universal architecture of positive and negative functional
                 connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual
                 variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants.
                 These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can
                 be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide
                 quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and
                 biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the
                 brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the

               processing and visualization tools within a controlled, secure
               environment. Its web interface is accessible through any modern

               technical expertise required to perform large-scale
               computational analyses. CBRAIN’s flexible meta-scheduling has

                 standardize multi-modal data integration and structured
                 metadata annotation. (2) The Connectome File Format Library

                 environment for visualization and analysis of multi-modal
                 connectome data. The Connectome Viewer's plugin architecture

                 neuroimaging techniques has gained considerable interest in
                 the neuroscience community. Using diffusion weighted (DWI) and
                 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), WM fiber pathways between
                 brain regions may be systematically assessed to make
                 inferences concerning their role in normal brain function,
                 influence on behavior, as well as concerning the consequences
                 of network-level brain damage. In this paper, we investigate
                 the detailed connectomics in a noted example of severe
                 traumatic brain injury (TBI) which has proved important to and
                 controversial in the history of neuroscience. We model the WM
                 damage in the notable case of Phineas P. Gage, in whom a
                 ``tamping iron'' was accidentally shot through his skull and
                 brain, resulting in profound behavioral changes. The specific
                 effects of this injury on Mr. Gage's WM connectivity have not
                 previously been considered in detail. Using computed
                 tomography (CT) image data of the Gage skull in conjunction
                 with modern anatomical MRI and diffusion imaging data obtained
                 in contemporary right handed male subjects (aged 25-36), we
                 computationally simulate the passage of the iron through the
                 skull on the basis of reported and observed skull fiducial
                 landmarks and assess the extent of cortical gray matter (GM)
                 and WM damage. Specifically, we find that while considerable
                 damage was, indeed, localized to the left frontal cortex, the
                 impact on measures of network connectedness between directly
                 affected and other brain areas was profound, widespread, and a
                 probable contributor to both the reported acute as well as
                 long-term behavioral changes. Yet, while significantly
                 affecting several likely network hubs, damage to Mr. Gage's WM
                 network may not have been more severe than expected from that
                 of a similarly sized ``average'' brain lesion. These results

                 not however always satisfactory because canonical methods for

                 intuitively and elegantly. A multimodal protocol for MRI/DTI

               of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization
               process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and
               ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is
               developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi
               users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We
               present here for the first time its functioning and settings.
               ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms
               used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical
               advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as
               the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and
               local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the
               Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we
               explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits
               from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many

  abstract    = "The disconnectivity hypothesis proposes that schizophrenia
                 results from poor or miswired anatomical connections.
                 Theoretically, its functional counterpart should be
                 disintegration. Integration is thought to allow segregated
                 neurons to interact as a coherent whole, referred to as the
                 ``core'', while the non-interacting part of the brain is
                 referred to as the ``rest''. In this study, it is suggested
                 that schizophrenia is the result of rest noise interfering
                 with core activity. Two possible causes are assessed: (i)
                 defective core integration, making the core more vulnerable to
                 noise from the rest, or (ii) the rest being too highly
                 integrated, meaning that it can interfere with the core. These
                 hypotheses were tested using fMRI data acquired from 13
                 stabilized medicated schizophrenic subjects compared to 11
                 matched controls. Subjects were required to perform a series
                 of lexical decision and retrieval tasks in separate sessions.
                 The brain was divided into 90 components. Integration was
                 defined as the amount of information shared between the
                 components of a sub-system. An iterative aggregation procedure
                 made it possible to identify a core on the basis of the
                 functional clustering index, which assesses the integration of
                 the core relative to its integration with the rest.
                 Correlation of component-pairs within the core was also
                 compared between the two groups. This procedure was repeated
                 for each subject and for each task. Cores did not differ
                 between the two groups, either in terms of integration or in
                 terms of functional clustering index. However, the core was
                 still highly integrated with the rest and the rest was overly
                 integrated in schizophrenic subjects. Both anomalies were
                 correlated with the negative symptoms. These findings were
                 consistent regardless of the task considered. Furthermore,
                 within the core, anterior-posterior correlations were lower in
                 patients (between the frontal and the parietal and posterior
                 cingulate cortices), whereas frontal left-right correlations
                 were excessive. No significant correlation was found with the
                 medication. Thus, it appears that schizophrenia entails a
                 deleterious combination of too much ``noisy'' integration
                 (from the rest) and too little ``significant'' integration
                 (anterior-posterior functional connectivity).",

                 and subcortical subregions in each of five healthy volunteers
                 studied in the (no-task) resting state. We note that
                 undirected graphs representing conditional independence
                 between multivariate time-series can be more readily
                 approached in the frequency domain than the time domain.
                 Estimators of partial coherency and normalized partial mutual
                 information phi, an integrated measure of partial coherence
                 over an arbitrary frequency band, are applied. Using these
                 tools, we replicate the prior observations that bilaterally
                 homologous brain regions tend to be strongly connected and
                 functional connectivity is generally greater at low
                 frequencies [0.0004, 0.1518 Hz]. We also show that
                 long-distance intrahemispheric connections between regions of
                 prefrontal and parietal cortex were more salient at low
                 frequencies than at frequencies greater than 0.3 Hz, whereas
                 many local or short-distance connections, such as those
                 comprising segregated dorsal and ventral paths in posterior
                 cortex, were also represented in the graph of high-frequency
                 connectivity. We conclude that the partial coherency spectrum
                 between a pair of human brain regional fMRI time-series
                 depends on the anatomical distance between regions:
                 long-distance (greater than 7 cm) edges represent conditional
                 dependence between bilaterally symmetric neocortical regions,
                 and between regions of prefrontal and parietal association

                 Low-frequency components in the time series subtended stronger
                 inter-regional correlations than high-frequency components.
                 Intrahemispheric connectivity was generally related to
                 anatomical distance by an inverse square law; many symmetrical
                 interhemispheric connections were stronger than predicted by
                 the anatomical distance between bilaterally homologous
                 regions. Strong interhemispheric connectivity was notably
                 absent in data acquired from a single patient, minimally
                 conscious following a brainstem lesion. Multivariate analysis
                 by hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling
                 consistently defined six major systems in healthy volunteers--
                 corresponding approximately to four neocortical lobes, medial
                 temporal lobe and subcortical nuclei- - that could be further
                 decomposed into anatomically and functionally plausible
                 subsystems, e.g. dorsal and ventral divisions of occipital
                 cortex. An undirected graph derived by thresholding the
                 healthy group mean partial correlation matrix demonstrated
                 local clustering or cliquishness of connectivity and short
                 mean path length compatible with prior data on small world
                 characteristics of non-human cortical anatomy. Functional MRI

              estimate frequency-dependent correlation matrices characterizing

              regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation matrices to

              small-world topology of sparse connections most salient in the
              low-frequency interval 0.03--0.06 Hz. Global mean path length
              (2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random
              network, whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar
              parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical
              connections in the macaque cortex. The human functional network
              was dominated by a neocortical core of highly connected hubs and
              had an exponentially truncated power law degree distribution.
              Hubs included recently evolved regions of the heteromodal
              association cortex, with long-distance connections to other
              regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal
              association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions
              were topologically more peripheral. The network was more
              resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable
              scale-free network, but about equally resilient to random error.
              We conclude that correlated, low-frequency oscillations in human
              fMRI data have a small-world architecture that probably reflects
              underlying anatomical connectivity of the cortex. Because the
              major hubs of this network are critical for cognition, its slow

               kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging
               Data Exchange (ABIDE)---a grassroots consortium aggregating and
               openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic
               resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding
               structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals
               with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7--64
               years) (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here,
               we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for
               advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360
               male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused
               on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey
               a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain
               architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly
               disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD
               literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity
               dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric
               functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of
               regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common
               loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and
               posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly

              Second, the tissue specificity of responses was probed using the
              better BOLD signal localization capabilities of a 7T scanner.
              Finally, the spatial distribution of 3 primary response
              types---namely positively sustained (pSUS), negatively sustained

                 fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity
                 between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of
                 these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated

                 are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize
                 and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a

                 The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional

  abstract    = "The brain is a complex dynamic system of functionally
                 connected regions. Graph theory has been successfully used to
                 describe the organization of such dynamic systems. Recent
                 resting-state fMRI studies have suggested that inter-regional
                 functional connectivity shows a small-world topology,
                 indicating an organization of the brain in highly clustered
                 sub-networks, combined with a high level of global
                 connectivity. In addition, a few studies have investigated a
                 possible scale-free topology of the human brain, but the
                 results of these studies have been inconclusive. These studies
                 have mainly focused on inter-regional connectivity,
                 representing the brain as a network of brain regions,
                 requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However,
                 using a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free
                 examination of both inter-regional as well as intra-regional
                 connectivity and might reveal new information on network
                 organization. Especially, a voxel-based study could give
                 information about a possible scale-free organization of
                 functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3
                 Tesla fMRI recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and
                 individual connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical
                 and sub-cortical voxels with connections reflecting
                 inter-voxel functional connectivity. Graph characteristics
                 from these connectivity networks were computed. The
                 clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much
                 higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random
                 graphs, together with a short average path length, indicating
                 a small-world organization. Furthermore, the connectivity
                 distribution of the number of inter-voxel connections followed
                 a power-law scaling with an exponent close to 2, suggesting a
                 scale-free network topology. Our findings suggest a combined
                 small-world and scale-free organization of the functionally
                 connected human brain. The results are interpreted as evidence
                 for a highly efficient organization of the functionally
                 connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with
                 their direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which
                 are held together by a small number of highly connected
                 hub-voxels that ensure a high level of overall connectivity.",

                 subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance
                 images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a
                 dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical
                 ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information
                 was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to
                 automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as
                 the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated
                 system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients
                 (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess
                 the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated
                 sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the
                 automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of
                 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of
                 less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded
                 little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These

                 blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) technique, which is the
                 favoured method because no intravenous contrast medium is
                 required, and the dynamic or exogenous technique. The BOLD
                 technique takes advantage of the fact that the change from
                 diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin to paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin that
                 takes place with brain activation results in decreased signal
                 intensity on MRI. Commercially available scanners can be used
                 to conduct single-slice BOLD fMRI experiments, but echo-planar
                 hardware is needed for multislice wholebrain experiments.
                 Sequence choices in BOLD fMRI include spin-echo and
                 gradient-echo sequences, to which rapid acquisition with
                 relaxation enhancement and echoplanar techniques may be
                 applied. Optimal imaging parameters (echo time, slice
                 thickness, field of view and flip angle) are important in
                 maximizing signal-to-noise ratios. Various statistical
                 techniques and software programs have been developed to
                 interpret the large amounts of data gathered from BOLD fMRI
                 experiments, which presents one of the biggest challenges in
                 performing this technique with clinical MR units. Controversy
                 exists regarding the effects of draining veins on cortical
                 mapping, of inflow of blood into the imaging slice or volume,
                 and of motion artifact. BOLD fMRI has demonstrated good
                 correlation with positron emission tomography,
                 magneto-encephalography and electrocorticographic recordings
                 of motor responses. It has been used to study cortical
                 activity of visual, motor, auditory and speech tasks as well
                 as brain centres for smell, motor imagery, complex motion and
                 memory. As such, it holds promise for the study of brain
                 function, but must be subjected to larger studies comparing it
                 with the gold standard of electrocorticographic mapping.",

                 therefore, high temporal resolution is possible in principle.
                 However, the temporal resolution is limited by a blurred
                 intrinsic hemodynamic response and a finite signal-to-noise
                 ratio. To determine the upper limit of temporal resolution in
                 a single area during repeated tasks, motor cortex activity was
                 investigated during visually instructed finger movements.
                 Without averaging, a sequence of four single-finger movements
                 with an execution time of approximately 2 s can be resolved
                 when the delay time between consecutive sequences is at least
                 3 s. The hemodynamic response time is constant for each
                 subject, but not among different subjects. The temporal
                 resolution can be better when the signal from spatially
                 distinct regions is examined. For a series of experiments
                 involving a visually instructed delayed cued finger movement
                 task with a well-defined, independently determined, variable
                 delay time, time courses in the motor area are distinct from
                 each other in two experiments if the difference in delay time
                 is as little as 2 s. The activation in the visual area due to
                 the presentation of the task serves here as an internal time
                 reference. By comparing a set of fMRI time courses in multiple

                 noninvasively identify locations of putative borders between
                 cortical areas (RSFC-boundary mapping; Cohen et al. 2008).
                 Here we describe a technique for using RSFC-boundary maps to
                 define parcels that represent putative cortical areas. These
                 parcels had highly homogenous RSFC patterns, indicating that
                 they contained one unique RSFC signal; furthermore, the
                 parcels were much more homogenous than a null model matched
                 for parcel size when tested in two separate datasets. Several
                 alternative parcellation schemes were tested this way, and no
                 other parcellation was as homogenous as or had as large a

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Current diagnostic systems for mental disorders
                 rely upon presenting signs and symptoms, with the result that
                 current definitions do not adequately reflect relevant
                 neurobiological and behavioral systems--impeding not only
                 research on etiology and pathophysiology but also the
                 development of new treatments. DISCUSSION: The National
                 Institute of Mental Health began the Research Domain Criteria
                 (RDoC) project in 2009 to develop a research classification
                 system for mental disorders based upon dimensions of
                 neurobiology and observable behavior. RDoC supports research
                 to explicate fundamental biobehavioral dimensions that cut
                 across current heterogeneous disorder categories. We summarize
                 the rationale, status and long-term goals of RDoC, outline
                 challenges in developing a research classification system
                 (such as construct validity and a suitable process for
                 updating the framework) and discuss seven distinct differences
                 in conception and emphasis from current psychiatric
                 nosologies. SUMMARY: Future diagnostic systems cannot reflect
                 ongoing advances in genetics, neuroscience and cognitive
                 science until a literature organized around these disciplines
                 is available to inform the revision efforts. The goal of the
                 RDoC project is to provide a framework for research to
                 transform the approach to the nosology of mental disorders.",

                 Findings across neuropsychology and neuroimaging point to
                 broad-based impairments that cross traditional diagnostic
                 boundaries. These dysfunctions are largely separate from the
                 classical symptoms of the disorders, and manifest in
                 regulatory problems in both traditional cognitive and

                 at 7 Tesla suffers from unexpectedly low temporal signal to
                 noise ratio (TSNR) compared to other brain regions. Various
                 methodologies were used in this study to quantitatively
                 identify causes of the noise and signal differences in
                 midbrain fMRI data. The influence of physiological noise
                 sources was examined using RETROICOR, phase regression
                 analysis, and power spectral analyses of contributions in the
                 respiratory and cardiac frequency ranges. The impact of
                 between-shot phase shifts in 3-D multi-shot sequences was
                 tested using a one-dimensional (1-D) phase navigator approach.
                 Additionally, the effects of shared noise influences between
                 regions that were temporally, but not functionally, correlated
                 with the midbrain (adjacent white matter and anterior
                 cerebellum) were investigated via analyses with regressors of
                 'no interest'. These attempts to reduce noise did not improve
                 the overall TSNR in the midbrain. In addition, the steady
                 state signal and noise were measured in the midbrain and the
                 visual cortex for resting state data. We observed comparable
                 steady state signals from both the midbrain and the cortex.
                 However, the noise was 2-3 times higher in the midbrain
                 relative to the cortex, confirming that the low TSNR in the
                 midbrain was not due to low signal but rather a result of
                 large signal variance. These temporal variations did not
                 behave as known physiological or other noise sources, and were
                 not mitigated by conventional strategies. Upon further
                 investigation, resting state functional connectivity analysis
                 in the midbrain showed strong intrinsic fluctuations between
                 homologous midbrain regions. These data suggest that the low
                 TSNR in the midbrain may originate from larger signal
                 fluctuations arising from functional connectivity compared to
                 cortex, rather than simply reflecting physiological noise.",

                 MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gradient-echo echo-planar fMRI
                 experiments were performed at 1.5 T and 3.0 T with varying
                 acquisition echo time and bandwidth, and with a 4 mm isotropic
                 voxel size. To analyze the BOLD sensitivity, the relative
                 contributions of BOLD signal amplitude and thermal and
                 physiologic noise sources were evaluated, and statistical
                 t-scores were compared in the motor area. RESULTS: At 1.5 T,
                 the number of activated pixels and the average t-score showed
                 a relatively broad optimum over a TE range of 60-160 msec. At
                 3.0 T, an optimum range was observed between TEs of 30-130
                 msec. Averaged over nine subjects, maxima in the number of

                 ratio at 3.0 T. CONCLUSION: The somewhat disappointing
                 increase in t-scores at 3.0 T was attributed to the increased
                 contribution of physiologic noise at the higher field strength
                 under the given experimental conditions. At both field
                 strengths, reducing the effective image acquisition bandwidth

Temporal signal stability was optimized by using spiral readout gradients. The sensitivity for detection of activated regions was assessed by measuring the number of “activated voxels” and their averagetscore in predefined regions of interest. When comparing fMRI experiments with the same total scan time, performed on six subjects, and with acquisition parameters optimized for each field strength separately, the 4.0-T scanner proved to give superior results, with a 70% greater number of activated voxels and a 20% higher averagetscore for the activated voxels.},

                 fluctuations in an fMRI time-course are dominated by
                 physiological modulations of the image intensity with
                 secondary contributions from thermal image noise and that
                 these two sources scale differently with signal intensity,
                 susceptibility weighting (TE) and field strength. The SNR of
                 the fMRI time-course was found to be near its asymptotic limit
                 for moderate spatial resolution measurements at 3 T with only
                 marginal gains expected from acquisition at higher field
                 strengths. In this study, we investigate the amplitude of
                 image intensity fluctuations in the fMRI time-course at
                 magnetic field strengths of 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T as a function
                 of image resolution, flip angle and TE. The time-course SNR
                 was a similar function of the image SNR regardless of whether
                 the image SNR was modulated by flip angle, image resolution,
                 or field strength. For spatial resolutions typical of those
                 currently used in fMRI (e.g., 3 x 3 x 3 mm(3)), increases in
                 image SNR obtained from 7 T acquisition produced only modest
                 increases in time-course SNR. At this spatial resolution, the
                 ratio of physiological noise to thermal image noise was 0.61,
                 0.89, and 2.23 for 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T. At a resolution of 1 x
                 1 x 3 mm(3), however, the physiological to thermal noise ratio
                 was 0.34, 0.57, and 0.91 for 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T for TE near
                 T2*. Thus, by reducing the signal strength using higher image
                 resolution, the ratio of physiologic to image noise could be
                 reduced to a regime where increased sensitivity afforded by
                 higher field strength still translated to improved SNR in the

                 human brain completely non-invasively using magnetic resonance
                 imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in which the
                 spin magnetization is refocussed by gradient switching are
                 sensitive to local changes in magnetic susceptibility, which
                 can occur when the oxygenation state of blood changes.
                 Cortical neural activity causes increases in blood flow, which
                 usually result in changes in blood oxygenation. Hence changes
                 of image intensity can be observed, given rise to the
                 so-called Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast
                 technique. Use of echo-planar imaging methods (EPI) allows the
                 monitoring over the entire brain of such changes in real time.
                 A temporal resolution of 1-3 s, and a spatial resolution of 2
                 mm in-plane, can thus be obtained. Generally in a brain
                 mapping experiment hundred of brain image volumes are acquired
                 at repeat times of 1-6 s, while brain tasks are performed. The
                 data are transformed into statistical maps of image
                 difference, using the technique known as statistical
                 parametric mapping (SPM). This method, based on robust
                 multilinear regression techniques, has become the method of
                 reference for analysis of positron emission tomography (PET)
                 image data. The special characteristics of functional MRI data
                 require some modification of SPM algorithms and strategies,
                 and the MRI data must be gaussianized in time and space to

                 movement effects, spatial smoothing, and statistical
                 interference, which includes temporal smoothing and removal by
                 fitting of temporal variations slower than the experimental
                 paradigm. By these means, activation maps can be generated
                 with great flexibility and statistical power, giving
                 probability estimates for activated brain regions based on
                 intensity or spatial extent, or both combined. Recent studies
                 have shown that patterns of activation obtained in human brain
                 for a given stimulus are independent of the order and spatial
                 orientation with which MRI images are acquired, and hence that
                 inflow effects are not important for EPI data with a TR much
                 longer than T1.",

                 assessment of brain function. This review article examines the
                 basic principles that underpin these measurements. The main
                 emphasis is on the characteristics and detection of blood
                 oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast. In the first part of
                 the article the relationship between BOLD, blood flow, blood
                 oxygen, and the rate of metabolic consumption of oxygen is
                 described. The four contrast mechanisms that contribute to the
                 BOLD signal change, namely extravascular static and dynamic
                 dephasing, intravascular T2-like changes, and the
                 intravascular frequency offset effect are described in terms
                 of their spatial localization and relative contributions to
                 the BOLD signal. The current model of changes in blood flow
                 being an indirect consequence of synaptic input to a region is
                 presented. The second section of the article deals with the
                 imaging characteristics of BOLD in terms of the attainable
                 spatial resolution and linear system characteristics. In the
                 third section, practical BOLD imaging is examined for choice
                 of pulse sequence, resolution, echo time (TE), repetition time
                 (TR), and flip angle. The final section touches on other MRI
                 approaches that are relevant to cognitive neuroimaging, in
                 particular the measurement of blood flow, blood volume,
                 resting state fluctuations in the BOLD signal, and measures of
                 connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging and
                 fiber-tracking.",
