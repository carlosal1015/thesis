<!--l. 3347--><p class="noindent" >The focus of this final chapter has been on the technology and modern practices for individual and
organized reproducible research. I have reviewed applications and virtual machines that I have developed to
exemplify how modern web and server technologies can be useful for researchers. The next
question pertains to how we can spur the development of these domain-specific tools, or provide
better resources for researchers to practice reproducible science. It is clear that we are in a
decade of change, and the development of better services, either provided by the university,
or by an emerging new level of &#8220;academic software developer,&#8221; can help this reproducibility
crisis.
<!--l. 3358--><p class="indent" >   If we have a vision for this kind of development, we must next determine the right path for making
that vision a reality. The standard now is for university systems to provide high performance
computing, some file storage, and limited places for web sites or blogs for groups to maintain an
interface to the public. It could be the case that a university establishes a university-wide resource
for reproducible tool development and training of researchers, or that the standard job-based
cluster resources are replaced with a container-based architecture that could capture and deploy
reproducible workflows. It could also be the case that a better collaboration with industry, and
providing research as a service, could save academia. A simple overview of best practices could be
provided to new students, and staff in the center might come from many flavors of science,
and would devote their time to developing domain-specific tools, or assisting researchers in
extending findings into tools that can be harnessed by others. Granting bodies might prioritize
establishing academic software developers across labs, and this expertise would be provided
on a local rather than university level. &#x00A0;While many continuous integration, version control,
and hosting services seem to offer long term products, the harsh reality is that there really
exists no insurance about any single web resource &#8220;being around forever.&#8221; However, with sound
research practices like creating multiple copies (redundancy), assigning digital object identifiers
(DOIs), and creating proper documentation, we can maximize the longevity and archiving of our
results.
